# HTML & CSS Template Two

This project is a responsive one-page website design created using HTML and CSS. The design is inspired by a tutorial from [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo) on YouTube and based on the Kasper One Page PSD template by [Graphberry](https://www.graphberry.com/item/kasper-one-page-psd-template).

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website layout adjusts to different screen sizes for a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Custom Fonts and Icons**: The project uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons, adding a modern touch to the design.
- **Clean and Simple Layout**: A minimalistic approach to design, focusing on readability and user experience.
